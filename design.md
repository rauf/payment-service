## Payment Gateway Service Design Document

### Architecture Overview
The payment service is built on a modular and extensible architecture, designed to seamlessly integrate various payment gateways and adapt to changing product requirements. 

### Key Components

1. Base Gateway
   * Generic struct baseGateway[Req, Res]
   * Handles common gateway operations like sending requests and retrying
   * Implements robust retry logic with customizable backoff strategies
   * Provides comprehensive error handling and logging
   
2. Serialization/Deserialization (Serde)
   * Interface-based approach for flexible data formatting
   * Allows easy switching between different data formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
   * Decouples data representation from gateway logic
 
3. Protocol Handler
   * Abstraction for communication protocols 
   * Enables support for various transport mechanisms without affecting gateway logic
   * Facilitates easy mocking for testing
 
4. Retry Configuration
   * Customizable retry logic with configurable backoff strategy
   * Allows fine-tuning of retry behavior based on gateway-specific requirements

5. Router
   * Used as the main entry point for the payment gateways.
   * Keeps a registry of the payment gateways.
   * Keeps track of the states of payment gateways using circuit breakers and route traffic to the correct gateway while also giving priority to the preferred gateway (if any)

### Design Decisions

1. Generic Base Gateway
   * Utilizes Go generics (baseGateway[Req, Res]) for type-safe request/response handling
   * Allows easy implementation of new gateways with minimal boilerplate code
   * Provides a consistent interface for all gateways while allowing for type-specific operations
2. Separation of Concerns
   * Serde, Protocol Handler, and Retry Config are implemented as separate, pluggable components
   * Enables easy swapping or updating of individual components without affecting others
3. Interface-Driven Design
   * Key components (Serde, Protocol Handler) are defined as interfaces
   * Facilitates easy mocking for testing, improving test coverage and reliability
   * Allows for multiple implementations of each component, supporting various use cases
4. Configurable Retry Mechanism
   * Customizable retry logic with pluggable backoff strategy
5. Error Handling and Logging
   * Comprehensive error handling with context preservation throughout the call stack
   * Structured logging using slog for better observability and easier log parsing
   * Clear distinction between different error types (e.g., gateway unavailable, context cancelled)
   
### Extensibility

1. Adding New Gateways
   * Implement a new struct that embeds baseGateway
   * Define gateway-specific request/response types
   * Implement any gateway-specific logic or overrides
   * Add the gateway to the gateway registry
2. Supporting New Protocols
   * Implement new protocol.Handler interface
   * Plug into existing gateway structure
3. Changing Data Formats
   * Implement new serde.Serde interface for the desired format
   * Update gateway initialization to use the new Serde implementation
4. Evolving Retry Strategies
   * Modify or create new backoff.RetryConfig implementations
   * Easily swap out retry strategies for different gateways or global changes
   * Example: Implementing a jittered exponential backoff strategy for improved distributed system performance
 
### Future Considerations
 
1. Metrics and Monitoring
   * Add hooks for collecting performance metrics (e.g., request latency, success rates)
   * Implement health check mechanisms for each gateway
   * Integrate with monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time visibility
2. Asynchronous Operations
   * Extend the design to support asynchronous payment operations if needed
   * Implement callback mechanisms or polling strategies for long-running transactions
